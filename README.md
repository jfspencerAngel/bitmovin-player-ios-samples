## Sample App Setup Instructions
Please execute `pod install --repo-update` to properly initialize the workspace. In each sample app, you also have to add your Bitmovin Player license key to `Info.plist` file as `BitmovinPlayerLicenseKey` or provide it via the `PlayerConfig.key` property.

In addition to that you have to log in to [https://bitmovin.com/dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard), where you have to add the following bundle identifier of the sample application as an allowed domain under `Player -> Licenses`:

    com.bitmovin.player.samples.playback.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.tv.playback.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.drm.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.casting.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.metadata.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.custom.ui.html
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.ads.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.systemui
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.offline.basic
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.playback.background
    com.bitmovin.player.samples.casting.advanced

## How to integrate the Bitmovin Player iOS SDK
When you want to develop an own iOS application using the Bitmovin Player iOS SDK read through the following steps.

### Adding the SDK To Your Project
To add the SDK as a dependency to your project, you have two options: Using CocoaPods or adding the SDK bundle directly.

#### Using CocoaPods
1. Add `source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'` to your Podfile.
1. Run `pod repo update` to add the newly added source.
1. Add `pod 'BitmovinPlayer', '3.25.0'` to your Podfile.
1. Install the pod using `pod install`.

See the `Podfile` of this repository for a full example.

#### Adding the SDK Directly
When using Xcode, go to the `General` page or your app target and add the SDK bundle (`BitmovinPlayer.xcframework`) under `Linked Frameworks and Libraries`. The latest SDK for iOS and tvOS can be downloaded [here](https://cdn.bitmovin.com/player/ios_tvos/3.25.0/BitmovinPlayer.zip).

#### Prepare your Bitmovin Player license

+   Add your Bitmovin player license key to the `Info.plist` file as `BitmovinPlayerLicenseKey`. Alternatively you can also set the license key via the `PlayerConfig.key` property when creating a `Player` instance.

    Your player license key can be found when logging in into [https://bitmovin.com/dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard) and navigating to `Player -> Licenses`.

+   Add the Bundle identifier of the iOS application which is using the SDK as an allowed domain to the Bitmovin licensing backend. This can be also done under `Player -> Licenses` when logging in into [https://dashboard.bitmovin.com](https://dashboard.bitmovin.com) with your account.

    When you do not do this, you'll get a license error when starting the application which contains the player.

## Development Notes
### Casting Requirements
* If you are using the Google Cast SDK (`BasicCasting` or `AdvancedCasting`), make sure the following requirements are met:
- Use a provisioning profile with `Access WiFi Information` enabled
- The `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` key is set in the `info.plist`
